# HotelBookingSystem

Project date: December 2021

It's my frist complete program, there is some issue if error made by users.


## Program introducation

The hotel has n rooms, numbers 1-n. The number of rooms is assigned to the program as standard. 

There are an even number of rooms between 40-80, and half of them (first half) are single and half (half) double rooms. 
Room rates are
· Single room: 100 euros per night and
· Double room: EUR 150 per night.

The program menu must be implemented in a versatile and illustrative way. The program needs to perform as much as possible problem situations. In the program, the rooms to be booked can either be drawn by machine or selected by the user. 

The program draws whether to give a 0%, 10% or 20% discount on the final price of the rooms. The user enters the room size and number of nights, and the program reports the total amount of the invoice after a possible discount. The program is ready to book rooms for as long as the user wants, however not more the above numbers of single and double rooms. The program always checks the room type before reservation to ensure their availability. At least two substantially different subroutines have been formed in the program.
